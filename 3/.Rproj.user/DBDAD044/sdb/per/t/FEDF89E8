The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv\n## file and returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the best\n## (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specified outcome in that state. The hospital\n## name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. The outcomes can be one of\n## “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”. Hospitals that do not have data on\n## a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the\n## rankings.\n##\n## Returns\n## A character vector with the name of the hospital with best 30-day mortality for\n## provided outcome \n## \nbest <- function(state, outcome) {\n  rankhospital(state, outcome, \"best\")\n}",
